# Project Name: Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform



## Description
The Pet Adoption Platform is an interactive web application designed to facilitate the adoption of pets.

The application connects potential pet owners with loving companions, making the adoption process simple and engaging.

2. **Category Filter**: Users can filter pets based on their categories (e.g., dogs, cats) for a more tailored browsing experience.
3. **Detailed View**: Clicking on a pet will open a modal displaying detailed information, including images, characteristics, and care information.
4. **Adoption Functionality**: Users can express their interest in adopting a pet, which triggers a confirmation modal with a countdown timer.
5. **Like Functionality**: Users can like their favorite pets, adding them to a liked pets section for easy access later.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Utilized for concise function expressions, especially in callbacks and array methods.
- **Template Literals**: Used to embed expressions and create multi-line strings for dynamic HTML generation.
- **Async/Await**: Implemented for handling asynchronous operations when fetching data from the API, improving readability.
